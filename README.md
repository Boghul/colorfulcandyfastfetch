Hello everyone,
i was inspired by a post from jan-rex and used the modified version from CarterLi (links to repo in config file).
The ip part was changed for multimedia, weather and os age.
Added customizable percent-bar and logo.
Added key symbols.
Change the symbols of the color row.
Made three rows of boxes with crossed color scheme.
Crossed color scheme for font.
Some changes at some format outputs.
And build so this colorful theme and ascii art.
